# TinyBI for React

Defines hooks for working with TinyBI from React applications:

- `useQuery` - the state of a query and the data it produces
- `usePageFilters` - a shared set of filters that chart components can interact via

Also some components:

- `TinyBITable` - renders queried data to a plain HTML table
- `Row` and `Column`
